# Project 1 Report Write up

Project one is an introduction to the first form of human-computer interaction: the command line interface. This project requires students to perform basic calculator operations in the command line setting. Students have the option to run the script using Java or c#, I chose Java. The basic function of the program is to let the user choose a mathematical operation or quit. Once it is chosen, the user continues by choosing two numbers to perform the operation. If the user chooses to quit, the program exits. My design approach was to display instructions so that the user could correctly input valid data. If the data is invalid, the program exits or asks the user to start the program again. Implementation challenges include the coding language used as I have not used Java in a long time. Another challenge is when to collect certain input from the user because sometimes the data is not needed. Lastly, validating user input so the program does not come across bugs. I learned a few refreshers about Java, the program shuts down from incorrect input, and implementing the correct data types for the assignment. To summarize, project 1 provided a great vision about what interfaces were like before graphic user interfaces. It may be less intuitive than graphic user interfaces but simple and way more easy to implement.
